                <p>My name is Maciej and I've built this page as my final project for General Assembly's Front End Web Development class. I took the course in early 2018 in San Francisco. At FEWD I've learned how to use CSS Grid and applied the learning here. All the resources listed on this page will help you learn the Grid.</p>

          <p>CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts built with HTML containers. CSS Grid Layout is easy to learn and use. It’s quickly changing the game for web design and development.</p>
          <p>This page will give you all the resources and links you need to get started with your first grid. You’ll also find here some resources on Firefox DevTools layout panel, which is the best way to get a glimpse of how the Grid works on your page.</p>
          <p>Lastly, feel free to inspect this site, as it was also built using CSS Grid. Get started by reading about the Grid on MDN and share the love for Grid.</p>
